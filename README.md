## Usage

```js
const telemetry = require('@telemetry-js/telemetry')()
const logzio = require('@telemetry-js/publisher-logzio-metrics')

telemetry.task()
  .collect(..)
  .schedule(..)
  .publish(logzio, { token: '***' })
```

## Format

Metrics are grouped by time and tags (known as _dimensions_ in Logz.io) into what Logz.io calls a _document_. Which looks like this:

```json
{
  "type": "custom",
  "token": "***",
  "@timestamp": 1599221440000,
  "metrics": {
    "telemetry.beep.count": 26,
    "telemetry.boop.count": 81,
  },
  "dimensions": {
    "environment": "test"
  }
}
```

Documents are then sent to Logz.io as NDJSON over TCP. This traffic is not encrypted.

## Options

### `token`

String, required. Secret token of Logz.io metrics account. Note that metrics accounts and their tokens are separate from log accounts.

### `resolution`

Expected millisecond interval between repeated metrics. A number or string to be parsed by [`bruce-millis`](https://github.com/vweevers/bruce-millis), default is 1 second. Metrics are grouped by their time, rounded to the nearest multiple of `resolution`.

If the resolution is too small then no grouping will occur, leading to inefficient documents. If the resolution is too large (i.e. more than your [schedule interval](../telemetry-schedule-simple) or [summarize window](../telemetry-processor-summarize)) then metrics - that have the same name and dimensions within that time window - will be overwritten, only sending the last value to Logz.io.

### `time`

Format of the `@timestamp` field. The right choice depends on how your Logz.io account is configured to parse timestamps. Can be one of:

- `'ms'`: unix timestamp in milliseconds (default)
- `'iso'`: [simplified extended ISO](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date/toISOString)
- `false`: don't add a `@timestamp` field, in which case metrics take the time at which they're received by Logz.io. If you're unsure which format to use, start with `false` and inspect raw logs in Logz.io to see which format Logz.io itself adds. Be aware that Logz.io silently drops documents that have an unexpected format.

### `type`

String, default `'custom'`. Log type for Logz.io to know how to parse documents.

### `hostname`

String, default `'listener.logz.io'`.

### `port`

Number, default `5050`.
